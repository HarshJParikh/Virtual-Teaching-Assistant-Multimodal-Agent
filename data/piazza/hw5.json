        "content": "So is there going to be a Homework 5 or not? I see multiple unanswered questions about when hw5 will be released. I leave in a couple days for a week long vacation. This was scheduled on purpose because when I signed up for this class, the USC SOC says this class ends on June 27th. If we have to have Homework due after the scheduled end of the class (which I donâ€™t agree is a good/fair idea even if it has been done this way before), I think the assignment should at least be posted by the last day of class to give people a chance to finish it early if they are able. Will the assignment be posted today or tomorrow so I have a chance to work on it before I go on vacation?",

I would very much like to at least know if I'm going to have to complete homework beyond the originally defined end dates of this summer course. As mentioned in another thread: 'I'll release them the day of, eg HW4 on Wed and HW5 on Thu. If I release them now or tomorrow, that can generate complaints too (it's happened before)!!' We are two days from the original end date of this course and it has been four days since the previous 'release date' for HW5. I would very much appreciate to know what the plan is for HW5.",
