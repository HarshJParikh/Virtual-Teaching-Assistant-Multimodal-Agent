        "content": "Hi Class, With the grading for the end term now finished we have released all grades on D2L. The end term grading was done very leniently and the Prof will be uploading the final grades to the University records by tonight. There will be no option to ask for a regrade for the end term marks so students are requested to not send any private Piazza posts/emails to the teaching staff. I know that the summer semester has been quite hectic but I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Prof Stay, the TAs & CPs and each and everyone of you for making this class a success. Cheers and FIGHT ON !!!!!",

The extra half hour is provided to you to make sure that you submit the paper properly and we won't accept any excuses from students for late submissions. NOTE: For the past exams we received many requests from students who were not able to submit on time due to a multitude of reasons ranging from internet issues to improper formats for their uploaded answers and we decided to accept all late submissions.Prof. Saty has instructed us to not make any exceptions for this exam as this is not fair to students who submitted on time, so no matter what the reason we won't be accepting late submissions this time. Make sure to prepare your submission in the allotted submission preparation time and get in touch with your proctor well before the end of your time slot in case you face any genuine issues. Any last-minute requests for accepting late submissions will be rejected and you will not be able to submit your exam. Total Time: 1 hr 30mins (for writing answers) + 30 mins (To prepare the submission) Exam Pattern:Midterm is an open book/open slides/open notes/open Google exam proctored in person THH 101. You can use any resources (slides, notes, google search, books) to answer the questions. You are not allowed to form groups with other students and collaborate during the exam. You are not allowed to post on online discussion forums like Stackoverflow etc.PS: We will soon provide you with the list of students approved for Online and Den mode, along with the proctoring Zoom links and their slots. Please make sure to monitor Piazza for updates regarding this information. (no changes from the midterm list) FAQs - Can I use Piazza during the exam to ask for clarifications of questions or doubts?You are NOT allowed to use piazza during and post the exam to discuss questions and potential answers of the exam. There could be adverse consequences of publicly posting on piazza during the exam unless there is a logistical emergency. Please email the lead TA or lead Course Producer in case of any logistical emergency.If you want to discuss a specific question after the exam, please create a private post for the instructors. No public posts should be created during or after the exam. - How will I get the exam question paper?The exam will be sent to your registered USC email id by Crowdmark. - How to attempt the exam?(Very Important**)Feel free to either type your answers, submitted pdf/images of hand written text or to use drawing software on iPads. Incase of handwritten text please make sure your handwriting is readable. - Which browser should you use?We recommend you to use Google Chrome. Some students using Safari faced issues while accessing Crowdmark. - Link to Crowd mark: https://app.crowdmark.com/sign-in - What should be the submission format?We recommend converting your answers to pdf before submission, but other formats supported by Crowdmark are also fine. Some students using iPhones faced issues with photo formats. So please be careful and double-check by previewing your answers before you actually submit the answers. - What if the page keeps reloading when you click on submit?Though unlikely, if this happens wait for 5 minutes. If the submission is not successful, submit it again. It is your responsibility to submit your solution on time. Please keep a buffer and do not wait to submit till the last minute. - Will there be diagrams to draw in the Midterm exam?The exam questions can ask you to draw a diagram. - What to check before submitting?Check all the photos of your answers are proper, they should not be tilted etc. They should be visible straight under your question, you can rotate the photos in Crowd mark before submission. So make sure your answers are submitted in a proper way instead of upside down or some other direction. Such answers will be ignored during evaluation and students will get a zero for that particular answer. - Can I resubmit before the exam submission deadline?Though we encourage you to submit everything correctly the first time, you can resubmit your answers any number of times before the deadline; just remember to submit every answer in your latest submission. All your previous submissions are overwritten by your latest submission. - Microphones during your zoom meeting for Den and Online proctoring?Microphones should be switched on always. No exceptions! If we find that you have muted the microphone, you will get warning from the proctor. The first warning comes with a penalty of 5 marks, the second warning comes with a penalty of 10 marks. Third warning gives you a zero in the exam. - Policies on noise/disturbance for den/online mode?You have to make sure that the place where you are giving the exam is quiet and there are no disturbances. If we hear any disturbance, you will get a first warning from the Proctor. First warning will come without a penalty, every consecutive warning will lead to a penalty of 5 marks. The same applies to in-person too. Please remain silent in the exam hall. - Can I ask questions?No, the Midterm Exam is an open book/open slides/open notes/open Google exam. We will not respond to any questions, if needed there will be announcements by the proctors, but no questions will be answered. For online mode , Note: Please don't disturb other students in the meeting room by asking them. Violating this rule will lead to a penalty of 4 marks for each violation. Same applies to in-person too. - Where should I give the exam for online mode?It is recommended that you give an exam in an isolated quiet place. You should not have anyone around you (one roommate is allowed in case of unavoidable circumstances) but you will have to make sure that your roommate is quiet and is not creating any disturbance. - When to join the meeting for online and den proctoring?Everyone should join the meeting 20 minutes before their respective exam time slot starts and make sure that you can access the CrowdMark platform. Logistics for online/Den mode:- You will receive the zoom room links soon that you must connect to during the exam time slots (or longer time for students with OSAS Accommodations).- Please try to connect to your provided Zoom link around 15mins prior to your time slot start time, to ensure you have no connectivity issues.- You MUST turn on the microphone on your device therefore please find a suitable spot in advance.- Anybody found cheating will be reported for an academic integrity violation.
