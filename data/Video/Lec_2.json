Copp\nIBM Research Laboratory, San Jose, California\n\nFuture users of large dato banks must be protected from\nhaving to know how the data is organized in the machine (the\nintemal representation). A prompting service which supplies\nsuch information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users\nft terminals and most application programs should remain\nunaffected when the intemal representation of data is changed\ncond even when some aspects of the extemal representation\ncre chonged. Changes in date representation will offen be\nneeded oso result of changes in query, update, and report\n\n\u2018The relational view (or model) of data described in\nSeotion 1 appears to be superior in several respects to the\ngraph or network model (3, 4] presently in vogue for nan-\ninferential systems. It provides a means of deseribing data\nwith its natural structure only\u2014that is, without superim-\nposing sny additional structure for machine representation\npurposes. Accordingly, it provides a basis for a high Level\ndata language which will yield maximal independence be-\ntween programs on the one hand and machine representa-\ntion and organization of data on the other.\n\nA further advantage of the relational view is that it\nforms s sound basis for treating derivability, redundanoy,\nand consistency of relations\u2014these are discussed in Section\n2. \u2018The network model, on the other hand, has spawned a\nnumber of confusions, not the feast of which is mistaking\nthe derivation of connections for the derivation of rela-\ntions (see remarks in Section 2 on the \u201ceonneetion trap\u2019)\n\nFinally, the relational view permits a clearer evaluation\n\n7:58:55 PM\n\n",
